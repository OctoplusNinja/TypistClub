## Inspiration ✨

Since pandemic everything is online and we genrally need to have high typing rate, that's why came up with this idea. It's just for single player mode but we are planning to have it for 1v1 too. Due to time and not having proper backend knowledge, we, for now restricted it to single ninja (player) mode.
